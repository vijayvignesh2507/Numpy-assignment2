# Jupyter Notebook with NumPy Readme

This readme provides a brief overview of using Jupyter Notebook with NumPy for scientific computing in Python.

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an interactive coding environment that allows you to experiment and prototype code easily. [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is a popular Python library for scientific computing, offering powerful array and matrix operations, as well as various mathematical functions.

In this case study, we explore how to leverage the capabilities of NumPy within Jupyter Notebook. We provide examples covering array creation, manipulation, mathematical operations, linear algebra, and random number generation.

To get started, open a Jupyter Notebook and import NumPy with the alias `np`. From there, you can perform a wide range of scientific computing tasks using NumPy's array-based operations and mathematical functions.

Feel free to explore the examples provided and use them as a starting point for your own scientific computing projects. Contributions and enhancements to this case study are welcome.
